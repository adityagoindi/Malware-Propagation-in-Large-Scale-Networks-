# Malware-Propagation-in-Large-Scale-Networks-

ABSTRACT

Malware are malicious software programs deployed by cyber attackers to compromise computer systems by exploiting their security vulnerabilities. Motivated by extraordinary financial or political rewards, malware owners are exhausting their energy to compromise as many networked computers as they can in order to achieve their malicious goals. A compromised computer is called a bot, and all bots compromised by a malware form a botnet. Botnets have become the attack engine of cyber attackers, and they pose critical challenges to cyber defenders. In order to fight against cyber criminals, it is important for defenders to understand malware behavior, such as propagation or membership recruitment patterns, the size of botnets, and distribution of bots. To date, we do not have a solid understanding about the size and distribution of malware or botnets. We practice this principle in this study. In this project, we study the distribution of malware in terms of networks (e.g., autonomous systems, ISP domains, abstract networks of smart phones who share the same vulnerabilities) at large scales. In this kind of setting, we have a sufficient volume of data at a large enough scale to meet the requirements of the SI model. Different from the traditional epidemic models, we break our model into two layers. Our contributions are summarized as follows. We propose a two layer malware propagation model to describe the development of a given malware at the Internet level. Compared with the existing single layer epidemic models, the proposed model represents malware propagation better in large scale networks. We find the malware distribution in terms of networks varies from exponential to power law with a short exponential tail, and to power law distribution at its early, late, and final stage, respectively. These findings are firstly theoretically proved based on the proposed model, and then confirmed by the experiments through the two large-scale real-world data sets.

INTRODUCTION

It is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is the analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in databases" process, or KDD.

Existing System

•	The epidemic theory plays a leading role in malware propagation modelling. The current models for malware spread fall in two categories: the epidemiology model and the control theoretic model. 
•	The control system theory based models try to detect and contain the spread of malware. The epidemiology models are more focused on the number of compromised hosts and their distributions, and they have been explored extensively in the computer science community. 
•	Zou et al. used a susceptible-infected (SI) model to predict the growth of Internet worms at the early stage. 
•	Gao and Liu recently employed a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to describe mobile virus propagation.

Disadvantages of Existing System

•	One critical condition for the epidemic models is a large vulnerable population because their principle is based on differential equations.
•	As pointed by Willinger et al. the findings, which we extract from a set of observed data, usually reflect parts of the studied objects. It is more reliable to extract the-oretical results from appropriate models with confirmation from sufficient real world data set experiments..


Proposed System

•	In this paper, we study the distribution of malware in terms of networks (e.g., autonomous systems, ISP domains, and abstract networks of smart phones who share the same vulnerabilities) at large scales. 
•	In this kind of setting, we have a sufficient volume of data at a large enough scale to meet the requirements of the SI model. Different from the traditional epidemic models, we break our model into two layers. 
•	First of all, for a given time since the breakout of a malware, we calculate how many networks have been compromised based on the SI model. 
•	Secondly, for a compromised net-work, we calculate how many hosts have been compromised since the time that the network was compromised.

Advantages of Proposed System

•	Our rigorous analysis, we find that the distribution of a given malware follows an exponential distribution at its early stage, and obeys a power law distribution with a short exponential tail at its late stage, and finally converges to a power law distribution.


Objectives of Proposed System

	In our analysis, we will illustrate that the distribution of a given malware follows an exponential distribution at its early stage, and obeys a power law distribution with a short exponential tail at its late stage, and finally converges.  
- If in any way IDS detects malware, then we alert you with the hash value of that file i.e. .Integrity verification.



ANALYSIS

Requirements

Project requirements are conditions or tasks that must be completed to ensure the success or completion of the project. They provide a clear picture of the work that needs to be done. They're meant to align the project's resources with the objectives of the organization.

Functional Requirements

Service Provider 
The Service Provider browses the required file, initializes nodes with digital signature and uploads to the end user (node a, node b, node c, node d, node e, node f) via Router. 
      Router 
         The Router is responsible for forwarding the data file in shortest distance to the destination; the Router consists of Group of nodes, the each and every node (n, n2,n3,n4,n5,n6,n7,n8,n8,n10,n11,  n12, n13)   consist of Bandwidth and Digital Signature. If router had found any malicious or traffic node in the router then it forwards to the IDS Manager. In Router we can assign the bandwidth for the nodes and can view the node details with their tags Node Name, Sender IP, Injected data, Digital Signature, Bandwidth and status. 
 	
Attacker 
         The malicious node or the traffic node details can be identified by a threshold-based classifier is employed in the Attack Detection module to distinguish DoS attacks from legitimate traffic. The Attacker can inject the fake message and generates the signature to a particular node in the router with the help of threshold-based classifier in testing phase and then adds to the attacker profile.

MODULES

Service Provider

In this module, the Service Provider browses the required file, initializes nodes with digital signature and uploads to the end user 
(node a, node b, node c, node d, node e, node f) via Router. 

Router

The Router is responsible for forwarding the data file in shortest distance to the destination; the Router consists of Group of nodes, the each and every node (n, n2,n3,n4,n5,n6,n7,n8,n8,n10,n11,  n12, n13)   consist of Bandwidth and Digital Signature. If router had found any malicious or traffic node in the router then it forwards to the IDS Manager. In Router we can assign the bandwidth for the nodes and can view the node details with their tags Node Name, Sender IP, Injected data, Digital Signature, Bandwidth and status. 

Attacker

In this module, the malicious node or the traffic node details can be identified by a threshold-based classifier is employed in the Attack Detection module to distinguish DoS attacks from legitimate traffic. The Attacker can inject the fake message and generates the signature to a particular node in the router with the help of threshold-based classifier in testing phase and then adds to the attacker profile. 

Epidemic model For Detecting Malware spreading

The IDS manager is nothing but Intrusion Detection System manager which is responsible to filter the malicious data and traffic data. The IDS manager decides the phases based on Router status and then decides on two phases i.e., the “Training Phase” and the “Test Phase”.

Training Phase

The Normal Profile Generation module is operated in the Training Phase to generate profiles for various types of legitimate traffic records, and the generated normal profiles are stored in a database. 

Test Phase

The Tested Profile Generation module is used in the Test Phase to build profiles for individual observed traffic records. Then, the tested profiles are handed over to the Attack Detection module, which compares the individual tested profiles with the respective stored normal profiles.

End User

In this module, the End user can receive the data file from the Service Provider which is sent via Router, if malicious or traffic node is found in the router then it forwards to the IDS Manager to filter the content and adds to the attacker profile. 


CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

In this paper, we thoroughly explore the problem of malware distribution at large-scale networks. The solution to this problem is desperately desired by cyber defenders as the network security community does not yet have solid answers. Different from previous modeling methods, we propose a two layer epidemic model: the upper layer focuses on networks of a large scale networks, for example, domains of the Internet; the lower layer focuses on the hosts of a given network. This two layer model improves the accuracy compared with the available single layer epidemic models in malware modeling. Moreover, the proposed two layer model offers us the distribution of malware in terms of the low layer networks. We perform a restricted analysis based on the proposed model, and obtain three conclusions: The distribution for a given malware in terms of networks follows exponential distribution, power law distribution with a short exponential tail, and power law distribution, at its early, late, and final stage, respectively. In order to examine our theoretical findings, we have conducted extensive experiments based on two real-world large-scale malware, and the results confirm our theoretical claims.
In regards to future work, we will firstly further investigate the dynamics of the late stage. More details of the findings are expected to be further studied, such as the length of the exponential tail of a power law distribution at the late stage. Secondly, defenders may care more about their own network, e.g., the distribution of a given malware at their ISP domains, where the conditions for the two layer model may not hold. We need to seek appropriate models to address this problem. Finally, we are interested in studying the distribution of multiple malware on large-scale networks as we only focus on one malware in this paper. We believe it is not a simple linear relationship in the multiple malware case compared to the single malware one.
